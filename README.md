# Website_1
Trying to make a website from scratch
- Forgot to actually push my previous code in the beginning because I didn't do the `git push origin main` but thats okay. Major kind of break through before
was that the hover action of css wasn't working and I figured out it was because a div object was covering it. I fixed it by just making it smaller.
